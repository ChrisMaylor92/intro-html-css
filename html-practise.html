            Richard "Rick" Sanchez of Dimension C-137, commonly referred to as
            Rick C-137, is the titular main protagonist of the Rick and Morty
            franchise. He is a megagenius[6] scientist whose alcoholism and
            reckless, nihilistic behavior are sources of concern for his
            "daughter's" family, as well as the safety of their son, Morty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon the series' inception, Rick's mysterious origins and mental
            health were large sources of speculation. It has since been revealed
            that in Dimension C-137, Rick was a humble scientist who was
            approached by Rick Prime with the offer of interdimensional travel.
            When Rick turned down his offer, Rick Prime murdered Diane and Beth
            Sanchez, prompting Rick to go on a lifetime hunt for revenge. Around
            the same time, Rick joined the Rebellion alongside Birdperson and
            Squanchy and fought against the Galactic Federation. Afterwards, for
            several decades, Rick killed countless amounts of his alternate
            selves in his ongoing hunt, before they surrendered and founded the
            Citadel of Ricks, with Rick overseeing its construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            He ultimately left The Citadel and landed in Rick Prime's original
            dimension, taking his place as the father of that dimension's Beth
            Smith and going on adventures with his new grandson, Morty. As the
            series has progressed, Rick has continuously committed more heinous
            acts[7][8] that often leave many individuals dead and cause conflict
            with the Smith family. Rick's morality has frequently come into
            question and many of the episodes shift Rick into a more
            antagonistic role.
